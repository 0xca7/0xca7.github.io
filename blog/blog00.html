                    The sample analyzed in this document is the ELF64 binary with the SHA256 hash value <emph>06e87fdd502778b1e2fceb93813aa1fcd322a3d0e8e20a5c516cc2f383db1cf0</emph>. 
                    The file command reveals this is a golang binary and not stripped, which makes analysis much easier.

                    The first function called in the main routine is named <emph>getClientDetails</emph>. 
                    This function utilizes the <emph>os</emph> and <emph>os/user</emph> libraries, retrieving the username the 
                    malware runs under <a href=#references>[1]</a> and the hostname <a href=#references>[2]</a> of the system. 
                    Further, <emph>getClientDetails</emph> uses a function <emph>getIP</emph> to obtain the IP address of the 
                    victim computer via https://api.ipify.org. This website is contacted using the <emph>Client</emph> type from 
                    the golang <emph>http</emph> library <a href=#references>[3]</a> via a GET request. This part is shown below.

                </center>

                <p>
                    After <emph>getClientDetails</emph>, the UserHomeDir and MkdirAll functions, both contained in the library <emph>os</emph>, are used to create the directory 
                    <emph>win32logs</emph> in the user's home.

                    The next routine, named <emph>handlePicDisplay</emph> performs a download of the image
                    <div class="listing">
                        [https://]i[.]imgur[.]com/zkE7Ge7[.]jpeg
                    </div>
                    , again via the http library, to the newly created win32logs directory. After the download
                    is completed, the gnome-open command is run on the downloaded image. 
                    I haven't figured out why this is done, I can only guess.

                <p>
                    After these first routines, the main section of the stealer starts its work.
                    In the figure below, you can see the main routines.

                <p>
                    The runtime_newproc function has a function pointer to the <emph>handleScreenshot</emph>. 
                    According to [4], a goroutine is translated to runtime.newproc, thus the handleScreenshot function
                    runs in a separate thread. In a last step, the function <emph>handleFileUpload</emph> is called,
                    which runs indefinitely.
                </p><br>

                
                <p>
                <emph>handleScreenshot</emph><br>
                This routine uses the library <emph>screenshot</emph> [5] to take screenshots. 
                Each screenshot is named [number].png, where [number] is incremented with each screenshot and saved
                to the win32logs directory. The github page of the screenshot library features an example which 
                comes pretty close to the code in the malware. The below figure shows a snippet of the routine.

                <emph>handleFileUpload</emph><br>
                This function utilizes another library that can be found on github: <emph>go-resumable</emph> [6]
                Which provides "multiple simultaneous and resumable uploads". Via this, the malware uploads the screenshots to

                Using <emph>strace</emph> a dynamic analysis was performed, confirming the findings

                Conclusion
            </div>
            Due to the binary not being stripped, the static analysis uncovered most of the stealer's functionality.
            It was also the first golang malware I analyzed, so that was greatly beneficial for me. 
            Although this malware is not very stealthy, creating 
            a directory visibly in the user's home, it may still be able to steal sensitive data during the time 
            it takes to be detected and deleted. Sadly, I was not able to find any information about how 
            this stealer finds its way to the victim machine. Because the files were successfully uploaded to the 
            URL found in the malware during the dynamic analysis, 
            it still seems to be very much alive and performing its malicious activity.
