<p>A couple of months ago I surprisingly won a voucher for  <em>The Art of Malware Analysis</em>
by @nu11charb (course: <a href="https://courses.null-char.com/courses/the-art-of-malware-analysis)">https://courses.null-char.com/courses/the-art-of-malware-analysis)</a>.</p>
<p>Time to do my part and review the course. I like small reviews, so I will keep it at that.</p>
<h2 id="review">Review</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a summary of the key points I noticed while doing the course.</p>
<h2 id="key-points">Key Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>very thourough, covers basic and intermediate malware analysis topics</li>
<li>expects students to do the supplied exercises to understand the material</li>
<li>works with real-world malware</li>
<li>covers x86 assembly in an accessible way</li>
<li>covers automating tasks and config extraction</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>The course starts with a general introduction to malware and the analysis
of malware. You start with some prerequisites, building a safe lab, further going towards basic static/dynamic analysis,
to x86 assembly, to advanced static/dynamic analysis and config extraction. The config extraction
part is something I was really looking forward to and I was not let down, I learned a lot from it.
The next part of the course covers YARA rules and automating various tasks, which is very important and
necessary when analyzing malware. You&rsquo;re gonna work with real-world malware by the way :)</p>
<p>It is expected that the students of the course do their homework - let&rsquo;s be honest here: If you&rsquo;re interested
in the topic you&rsquo;ll do it anyway and when you learn something new you&rsquo;re gonna have to put the time in, doesn&rsquo;t
matter what topic it is. It&rsquo;s good that this is addressed. As I said in my PMAT review: You&rsquo;re not gonna grow
muscle if you read a book about bodybuilding, you have to lift weights for that. Same goes for everything
else that&rsquo;s practical in nature. I liked what Ahmed says here: Malware Analysis requires research, you&rsquo;ll need to look things up -
I fully agree with him there. MSDN and Google are your friends. Nevertheless, you are supplied with all of the
knowledge you need by this course, you&rsquo;re going to have the basics down and the means to help yourself when
navigating through malware unknown to you. Ahmed does an excellent job here, doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re a beginner or
already have some experience, he teaches you what you need to know from the very bottom to intermediate level. I also
like his way of talking, teaching and bringing the topics across. By the way, it&rsquo;s really easy to follow along with him while
watching the videos. In order to get a deeper understanding, you&rsquo;re supplied with exercises so you can really dig in. There is a discord for the course
if you need help or get stuck as well.</p>
<p><strong>In summary: The course is very thourough, beginner friendly and accessible for anyone who wants to learn. I can only recommend this course, for me
personally it&rsquo;s a 10/10. If you want to get an impression, just go to Ahmed&rsquo;s YouTube channel and see for yourself: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0vsNncAvJlPh2XGUi5s33Q">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0vsNncAvJlPh2XGUi5s33Q</a></strong></p>
